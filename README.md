### Improved Website Performance
One of the most important SEO factors that influences your positions in Google is website performance. There are different reasons it may be not as you expect it to be. However, when it comes to Magento 2 the reason for slow-loading website could be images. The bigger the image size the longer it will load and the longer the page loads the worse general website performance. Magento 2 WebP Images extension allows you to avoid that and create a fast website.

### Better SEO Ranking
As mentioned about, there is a direct link between website performance and the position it is placed on in Google. Top Google’s priority is to provide its  users with the best results. But even if your content is one of the best, people are not going to learn about it because of the poor website loading speed. Converting images to WebP format, that is smaller in size than the usual JPN,JPG or GIF,  improves your website performance and SEO in general.

If someone comes to your website from any of those browsers that don’t support WEBP your original PNG or JPG formats will be loaded.
